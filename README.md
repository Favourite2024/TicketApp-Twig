# TicketApp â€” Twig Implementation

## Overview
**TicketApp** is a fully responsive ticket management web application built with **Twig (PHP)**.  
It simulates authentication and ticket CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using **localStorage**, maintaining a consistent layout and design language shared across **React**, **Vue.js**, and **Twig** versions.

---

## Features
- **Landing Page:** Hero section with SVG wave, decorative circles, and clear call-to-action buttons.  
- **Authentication:** Login and Signup pages with inline validation and toast/snackbar notifications.  
- **Dashboard:** Displays KPIs for total, open, in-progress, and closed tickets.  
- **Ticket Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality with validation and feedback.  
- **Authorization Guards:** Restricts Dashboard and Tickets pages to authenticated users only.  
- **Responsive Layout:** Max width 1440px, centered layout, fully responsive across all devices.  
- **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML, visible focus states, and sufficient color contrast.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)  
- **Templating Engine:** Twig (PHP)  
- **Storage:** localStorage (no backend required)
